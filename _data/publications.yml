# THE WEIRDEST BUG: using escapes requires single-quotes instead of double...

#Style Guide: Publications
# citation - double quotes, to avoid breaking on names with apostrophes
# all other sections - indent with 2 spaces, strings in single quotes

#Names of lab members should be bolded using the following convention: **Surname FM**.
#If there are multiple lab members in a row, include them in one set of double asterisk pairs.
#Use &#42; to add an asterisk denoting co-first/corresponding author. Otherwise, bolding of names using **Surname FM** will break.
#For readability of code, start a new line around 140 characters.
#All images and PDFs should be named using the following convention: surname_YYYY

#Leave PMID and PMCID blank until an ID is assigned.

#Do not include additional subsections if they are not relevant
#to a publication (PDB, data, Zenodo, etc).

#Order of links: GitHub/Data/Server, Lab Websites (alphabetical order), Facility, Twitter, F1000, News Articles
#Put article strings in single quotes since they are separated by a colon -- i.e. CNN: Article Name.
